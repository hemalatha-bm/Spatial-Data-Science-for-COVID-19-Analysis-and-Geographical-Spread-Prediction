The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of understanding disease spread across different geographical regions. This project leverages Spatial Data Science techniques to analyze, model, and visualize the global spread of COVID-19 using geographic and epidemiological data.

Spatial data science focuses on analyzing data with a geographical component, enabling deeper insights into regional patterns, hotspots, recovery trends, and mortality rates. By integrating COVID-19 case data with latitude and longitude information, this project provides a comprehensive spatial perspective of the pandemic.

**Objectives**

To analyze the geographical distribution of COVID-19 cases worldwide

To develop spatial models that help predict the spread of COVID-19 across regions

To determine the maximum cured (recovery) rate and death rate on a country-wise basis

To visualize COVID-19 trends and predictions across different geographical regions

**Datasets Used**

WHO COVID-19 Global Dataset – confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries

World Countries & USA States Latitude–Longitude Dataset – for spatial mapping and visualization

**Data Preprocessing**

Data preprocessing plays a crucial role in this project. It involves:

Cleaning missing, inconsistent, and duplicate values

Integrating multiple datasets into a unified structure

Standardizing country names and geographical coordinates

Preparing clean and reliable data for spatial analysis

The datasets are thoroughly explored and combined to ensure accurate and meaningful geographical visualizations.

**Visualization & Analysis**

Country-wise COVID-19 spread visualization

Heatmaps to identify hotspots and high-risk regions

Graphical comparison of death and recovery rates

Geographic mapping using longitude and latitude data

**Outcome**

This project demonstrates how spatial data science can support data-driven decision-making during global health crises. The insights generated can help policymakers, researchers, and healthcare professionals understand regional impacts and plan mitigation strategies effectively.
